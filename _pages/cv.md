Are you building a team to unravel the misteries of the mind? I have a strong technical and theorical background to offer, as well as more than 15 years of experience working in interdisciplinary teams. I can help you design cognitive science experiments with high precision and technical reliability without paying for any licenses. Openness and reproducibility are my focus. I'm currently looking for a team to work with. If you think I could be a good fit for yours, please contact me. [Find my CV here](/files/cv.pdf)
