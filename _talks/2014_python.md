In collaboration with the [**IEEE Student Branch**](/files/certificates/2014_Python.pdf), I gave a 40 hr Python workshop to students of the Engineering Faculty. The goal of this workshop was to compliment the students' education with a practical approach to programming. The workshop was given in Spanish.
