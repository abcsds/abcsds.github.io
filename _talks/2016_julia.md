With the goal of keeping up with state of the art methods for computational simulation, I prepared and imparted a 15 hrs course on high performance computing with the **Julia** programming language for the [Natural and Exact Sciences Division of the Guanajuato State University](/files/certificates/2016_Julia.pdf). The workshop was given in Spanish.
