In collaboration with the [**Clubes de Ciencia**](/files/certificates/2016_Clubes.pdf), I aided in the organization and technical execution of a week-long workshop for high school students. The workshop was focused on the basics of Quantum Computing, and the students were able to program their own quantum algorithms. The workshop was given in Spanish and English.
