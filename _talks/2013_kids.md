As part of the _Ciencia en Movimiento_ program, and in collaboration with the [Guanajuato Network for Science Communication](/files/certificates/2014_SciComm.pdf), I gave talks to elementary school kids with topics like cognitive science, epistemology, and meta-science. The goal was to inspire kids to pursue a career in science, and to show them that science is not only for adults. The talks were given in Spanish.
