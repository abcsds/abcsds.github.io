Along with my collaborators, we presented a startup initiative at the Oxford University Urban Innovation Forum. The [TimeLayers](http://timelayers.org/) initiative was aimed at creating a platform for the visualization of urban data, with the goal of overlaying historic pictures to current urban landscapes. This project was part of the [Public Entrepreneurship Laboratory](https://let-emprendimientopublico.mx/en/) at the [School of Government and Public Transformation](https://tec.mx/en/schools/school-government-public-transformation) of the [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en). The talk was given in English.
